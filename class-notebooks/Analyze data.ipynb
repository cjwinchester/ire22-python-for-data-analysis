    "In this notebook, we'll explore how to use the [_pandas_](https://pandas.pydata.org/) data analysis library to perform some basic analysis on a CSV file assembled from a bunch of inconsistently formatted spreadsheets with data from the FAA on [laser pointer incidents](https://www.faa.gov/about/initiatives/lasers/laws) from 2010 to mid-2022.\n",
    "\n",
    "(If you're interested in how those files were downloaded and cleaned, you can check out the [`Download data.ipynb`](Download%20data.ipynb) and [`Combine and clean spreadsheets.ipynb`](Combine%20and%20clean%20spreadsheets.ipynb) notebooks, though they're a bit more complicated and we probably won't have time today to get into them today.)\n",

    "Before you can use the functionality of the _pandas_ library, which we installed prior to the class, you have to import it into your script. The convention for doing so is to use an alias to import pandas _as_ `pd` -- just saves you a few keystrokes every time you need to use one of its tools."

    "### Loading and inspecting data\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you can use pandas to analyze your data, you first need to load the data into a _data frame_, which is a sort of virtual spreadsheet with columns and rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can load many different types of data files into a data frame, including CSVs and other delimited text files, Excel files, JSON and more. ([Here's a quick reference notebook](../cheat-sheets/Importing%20data%20into%20pandas.ipynb) demonstrating how to import some common data files, including data pulled directly from the Internet.)\n",
    "\n",
    "For today, we'll focus on importing the laser pointer data using a pandas method called [`read_csv()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.read_csv.html). There are a ton of options you can pass in when you read in the data file, but at minimum, you need to tell the method _where_ the file lives, which means you need to supply the path to the data file as a Python string (some text enclosed in single or double quotes).\n",
    "\n",
    "The file is called `faa-laser-incidents.csv`, and it is located in the same directory as this notebook file, so we don't need to specify a longer path.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally -- something I found out once I started to explore the data -- we need to tell pandas to import empty values as an empty string rather than a specific kind of null value. (The details aren't important here, but this will save us from having to convert between data types later -- my Google was \"[pandas empty strings instead of nan import](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&q=pandas+empty+strings+instead+of+nan+import)\" because although I have done this operation dozens of times, I literally never remember this, which led me to [our good friend StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/43832955) and _boomtown_ we're in business.)\n",
    "\n",
    "As we import the data, we'll also _assign_ the results of the loading operation to a new variable called `df`, short for data frame -- easy to type, plus you'll see this convention a lot when Googling around for help. You can see more information on variable assignment in the Python syntax notebook."

    "- What happens when the parser tries to convert a value to a number that can't be converted to a number -- like the string `UNKN` in this data? The default behavior is to raise an error, but then we're stuck, so instead let's coerce those unparseable values to nulls and later exclude them if needed. To do this, you can specify keyword argument `errors='coerce'` (see [the method documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.to_numeric.html) for other options.)"
